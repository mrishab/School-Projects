Ferry Reservation System
Final Project Submission
Course: Introduction to Programming - COMP-150
Instructor: John Quah

This program is built using structural programming in C++. The program can be used to selectively book seats on a ferry deck. The information entered by the user is saved in a file. Also, the same information is read from the file about the seats booked so that they cannot be booked again.
